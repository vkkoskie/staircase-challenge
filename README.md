# 2022 Challenge Reference

This code is in support of [this boardgamekeek.com challenge](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/301357/2022-staircase-challenge-flexible-alternative-clas).

# Instructions

If you're unfamiliar with programming and/or Python, use the web-based Python
Playground to run this program:

* Visit https://lwebapp.com/en/python-playground
* Copy and paste the entirety of [staircasehelper.py](staircasehelper.py) into
  the left textbox.
* Follow the instructions in that file to edit the all-caps values at the top
  (up to and including `ALL_GAMES`) to match your challenge details and display
  preferences. In some cases, alternative settings are left as comments
  (anything after a "#"). These lines are inert and aren't part of the program.
  In those cases, you can simply remove the "#" and put a "#" in front of the
  setting you don't want.
* Click the blue `Run` button to generate output in the right textbox.
* Copy the contents of the right textbox excluding the first two lines
  (copied lines should begin with a `[size=24]` tag).
* Paste this into your BGG post.
* To update your plays, repeat this entire procedure. You can save your
  tweaked version of the program to make the process easier. Then you would
  only need to update the `ALL_GAMES` table each time.

If you already know how to run Python scripts:

* You can clone this repo or download/copy staircasehelper.py to run.
* Follow the instructions in that file to edit the all-caps values at the top
  (up to and including `ALL_GAMES`) to match your challenge details and display
  preferences.
* Run the script and copy/paste the output into your BGG post.
* To update your plays, simply update the `ALL_GAMES` table, rerun the
  script, and edit your post with the new content.
* If there's a bugfix or improvement you think would be useful to general
  users, I will happily accept both Issues and Pull Requests.
